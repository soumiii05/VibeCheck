Project Overview
Name: VibeCheck  
Type: AI-powered internal tool  
Timeframe:[e.g. June–July 2025]  
Built With:Slack API, Python, Hugging Face, Supabase

Problem

Remote/hybrid teams lose visibility into how teammates are feeling. HR surveys are too slow or ignored. Emotional misalignment leads to silent burnout and turnover.

Solution

A Slack-based AI bot that checks in with teammates, analyzes sentiment and emotion, and sends weekly team summaries—non-intrusive, lightweight, and fully async.

Research & Validation

- Interviewed 4 remote team leads and 6 employees
- Found that most didn’t like long HR surveys but appreciated brief, async check-ins
- Privacy and emotional safety were top concerns


MVP Scope

- Slack command `/checkin`
- Weekly DM check-in trigger
- Sentiment + emotion analysis via Hugging Face
- Summary report per team
- Supabase for secure storage

Key Results

- MVP tested in a 6-person mock team  
- 100% weekly response rate for 3 weeks  
- Managers reported better pulse-check awareness  
- 4/6 team members said it “made them feel heard”

Future Iterations

- Graphical dashboard with 4-week mood trends  
- Manager alerts on mood decline  
- Burnout risk detection  
- Integration with other async tools (e.g. Notion, Google Calendar)

What I Learned as a PM

- How to define an MVP tightly scoped around a real pain point  
- The balance between privacy and actionable insights in AI design  
- How to communicate model outputs clearly and sensitively to non-technical users  
- Importance of testing feature tone (e.g. not too clinical, not too informal)
